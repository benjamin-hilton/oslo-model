# oslo-model

A C++ implementation of a numpy module for the Oslo rice-grains model exhibiting self-organised criticality.

(I'm not sure I uploaded the latest version of this code, sorry! There may be errors resulting from what I backed up. Code from 2018).

main.py contains a script using the module to carry out some basic tasks.
